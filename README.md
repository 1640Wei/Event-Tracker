### Project Name:  Event Tracker

### Date:  Nov 3, 2023

### Description:
This project retrieves event data through the NASA Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) API. Users can input dates through a GUI and display events that fall within the specified date range.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
  
- **Tkinter**: Python library for building GUI (graphical user interfaces).

- **Requests Library**: Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve data from the EONET API.

- **Socket Library**: Employed to configure DNS servers within the `set_dns` function.

- **JSON Library**: Utilized for parsing JSON-formatted data obtained from the API.


### Project Structure:Ôºö
- `gui.py`ÔºöMain code for the GUI interface.
- `event_tracker.py`ÔºöMain code for handling event tracking functionality


### Example:

- Enter the start date and end date, then click the Submit button. If there are events within the specified range, they will be displayed in the scrolling text box below.

### Notice:

#### 1. DNS Configuration

DNS (Domain Name System) is a service that translates human-readable domain names into machine-understandable IP addresses. In this project, the accuracy of DNS configuration ensures that the program accurately resolves domain names to their corresponding IP addresses, facilitating successful sending and receiving of network requests. Incorrect DNS configuration could lead to failed domain name resolution, preventing the code from accessing external resources, such as an API. 

To ensure smooth communication, the project utilizes Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8).

```python
dns_server = "8.8.8.8"
set_dns(dns_server)
```

### Update Log:
- Version 1.0.0 (Nov 3, 2023)

Initial release, featuring the basic GUI and event tracker functionality.
